No recent study has reported on Uganda\\u2019s state of public sector prosthetics services. This study aimed to document the landscape of major limb loss, and the structure of available prosthetics services in Uganda. Methods: This study involved a retrospective review of medical records at Mulago National Referral Hospital, Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital, and Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, and a cross-sectional survey of personnel involved in the fabrication and fitting of prosthetic devices across orthopaedic workshops in the country. Results: Upper limb amputations accounted for 14.2%, and lower limb accounted for 81.2%. Gangrene (30.3%) was the leading cause of amputation, followed by road traffic accidents and diabetes mellitus. Orthopaedic workshops offered decentralised services, and most materials used were imported. Essential equipment was largely lacking. Orthopaedic technologists had diverse experience and skill sets, but many other factors limited their service provision. Conclusion: The Ugandan public healthcare system lacks adequate prosthetic services both in terms of personnel and supporting resources, including equipment, materials, and components. The provision of prosthetics rehabilitation services is limited, especially in rural regions. Decentralising services could improve patients\\u2019 access to prosthetic services.Implications for Rehabilitation Availability and accessibility of prosthetic services are essential to the rehabilitation and reintegration of amputees into communities in Low-and-Middle-Income countries (LMICs). For stakeholders to formulate effective plans to address issues within prosthetics service provision, quality data on the current state of services is necessary. Service providers should prioritise the decentralisation of prosthetic rehabilitation services, especially for patients in rural areas, to improve access and reach of these services. To achieve optimal limb functionality after amputation for both lower and upper limb amputees, rehabilitation professionals working in LMICs should focus on delivering comprehensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation services. Orthopaedic personnel should ensure complete and accurate documentation of patient information following amputation to enable effective tracking and monitoring of patient care to improve outcomes of rehabilitation. \\u00a9 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\",\n          \"Background: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients have been shown to not achieve normal sagittal plane hip kinematics. However, previous studies have only conducted group level analysis and as such lack the sensitivity to highlight whether individual patients do achieve normal hip kinematics. As such this study looked to determine whether some patients with well-functioning THA achieve typical sagittal plane hip kinematics. Methods: Sagittal plane hip kinematics were collected on 11 well-functioning THA patients (Oxford Hip Score = 46 \\u00b1 3) and 10 asymptomatic controls using a 3-dimensional motion analysis system during self-paced walking. High-functioning THA patients were identified as those who displayed sagittal plane hip kinematics that were within the variance of the control group on average, and low-functioning patients as those who did not. Results: 5 THA patients were identified as high-functioning, displaying hip kinematics within the variance of the control group. High-functioning THA patients displayed peak hip flexion and extension values more closely aligned to asymptomatic control group than low-functioning patients. However, hip range of motion was comparable between high- and low-functioning total hip arthroplasty patients and reduced compared to controls. Conclusion: The presence of high-functioning THA patients who display comparable sagittal plane hip kinematics to controls suggests these patients do achieve normative function and challenges the conclusions of previous group level analysis. Understanding why some patients achieve better function post-operatively will aid pre- and post-operative practices to maximise functional recovery. \\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.\",\n          \"Background: Terrorist incidents lead to a range of mental health outcomes for people affected, sometimes extending years after the event. Secondary stressors can exacerbate them, and social support can provide mitigation and aid recovery. There is a need to better understand distress and mitigating factors among survivors of the Manchester Arena attack in 2017. Aims: We explored three questions. First, what experiences of distress did participants report? Second, how might secondary stressors have influenced participants' psychosocial recoveries? Third, what part has social support played in the relationships between distress and participants' recovery trajectories? Method We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of a convenience sample of survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing (N = 84) in January 2021 (3 years 8 months post-incident), and a longitudinal study of the same participants' scores on mental health measures over 3 years from September 2017. Results: Survivors' mental well-being scores in early 2021 were significantly lower than general population norms. Longitudinal follow-up provided evidence of enduring distress. Secondary stressors, specifically disruptions to close relationships, were associated with greater post-event distress and slower recovery. We found an indirect relationship between identifying with, and receiving support from, others present at the event and mental well-being >3 years later. Conclusions: The Arena attack has had an enduring impact on mental health, even in survivors who had a mild response to the event. The quality of close relationships is pivotal to long-term outcome. Constructive support from family and friends, and people with shared experiences, are key to social cure processes that facilitate coping and recovery.

No recent study has reported on Uganda\\u2019s state of public sector prosthetics services. This study aimed to document the landscape of major limb loss, and the structure of available prosthetics services in Uganda. Methods: This study involved a retrospective review of medical records at Mulago National Referral Hospital, Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital, and Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, and a cross-sectional survey of personnel involved in the fabrication and fitting of prosthetic devices across orthopaedic workshops in the country. Results: Upper limb amputations accounted for 14.2%, and lower limb accounted for 81.2%. Gangrene (30.3%) was the leading cause of amputation, followed by road traffic accidents and diabetes mellitus. Orthopaedic workshops offered decentralised services, and most materials used were imported. Essential equipment was largely lacking. Orthopaedic technologists had diverse experience and skill sets, but many other factors limited their service provision. Conclusion: The Ugandan public healthcare system lacks adequate prosthetic services both in terms of personnel and supporting resources, including equipment, materials, and components. The provision of prosthetics rehabilitation services is limited, especially in rural regions. Decentralising services could improve patients\\u2019 access to prosthetic services.Implications for Rehabilitation Availability and accessibility of prosthetic services are essential to the rehabilitation and reintegration of amputees into communities in Low-and-Middle-Income countries (LMICs). For stakeholders to formulate effective plans to address issues within prosthetics service provision, quality data on the current state of services is necessary. Service providers should prioritise the decentralisation of prosthetic rehabilitation services, especially for patients in rural areas, to improve access and reach of these services. To achieve optimal limb functionality after amputation for both lower and upper limb amputees, rehabilitation professionals working in LMICs should focus on delivering comprehensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation services. Orthopaedic personnel should ensure complete and accurate documentation of patient information following amputation to enable effective tracking and monitoring of patient care to improve outcomes of rehabilitation. \\u00a9 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\",\n          \"Background: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients have been shown to not achieve normal sagittal plane hip kinematics. However, previous studies have only conducted group level analysis and as such lack the sensitivity to highlight whether individual patients do achieve normal hip kinematics. As such this study looked to determine whether some patients with well-functioning THA achieve typical sagittal plane hip kinematics. Methods: Sagittal plane hip kinematics were collected on 11 well-functioning THA patients (Oxford Hip Score = 46 \\u00b1 3) and 10 asymptomatic controls using a 3-dimensional motion analysis system during self-paced walking. High-functioning THA patients were identified as those who displayed sagittal plane hip kinematics that were within the variance of the control group on average, and low-functioning patients as those who did not. Results: 5 THA patients were identified as high-functioning, displaying hip kinematics within the variance of the control group. High-functioning THA patients displayed peak hip flexion and extension values more closely aligned to asymptomatic control group than low-functioning patients. However, hip range of motion was comparable between high- and low-functioning total hip arthroplasty patients and reduced compared to controls. Conclusion: The presence of high-functioning THA patients who display comparable sagittal plane hip kinematics to controls suggests these patients do achieve normative function and challenges the conclusions of previous group level analysis. Understanding why some patients achieve better function post-operatively will aid pre- and post-operative practices to maximise functional recovery. \\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.\",\n          \"Background: Terrorist incidents lead to a range of mental health outcomes for people affected, sometimes extending years after the event. Secondary stressors can exacerbate them, and social support can provide mitigation and aid recovery. There is a need to better understand distress and mitigating factors among survivors of the Manchester Arena attack in 2017. Aims: We explored three questions. First, what experiences of distress did participants report? Second, how might secondary stressors have influenced participants' psychosocial recoveries? Third, what part has social support played in the relationships between distress and participants' recovery trajectories? Method We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of a convenience sample of survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing (N = 84) in January 2021 (3 years 8 months post-incident), and a longitudinal study of the same participants' scores on mental health measures over 3 years from September 2017. Results: Survivors' mental well-being scores in early 2021 were significantly lower than general population norms. Longitudinal follow-up provided evidence of enduring distress. Secondary stressors, specifically disruptions to close relationships, were associated with greater post-event distress and slower recovery. We found an indirect relationship between identifying with, and receiving support from, others present at the event and mental well-being >3 years later. Conclusions: The Arena attack has had an enduring impact on mental health, even in survivors who had a mild response to the event. The quality of close relationships is pivotal to long-term outcome. Constructive support from family and friends, and people with shared experiences, are key to social cure processes that facilitate coping and recovery.

The term is used to describe people who habitually seek entertainment or companionship in the night-time hours. Waits refers implicitly to Hopper\\u2019s work throughout the song, using metaphorical language to present a first-person account of the emotional state of a nighthawk by drawing on the weather report format. Waits\\u2019 language relies on the listener\\u2019s specific geographical, meteorological and cultural knowledge to understand his communicative intention. The song prompts the listener to bring different levels of encyclopaedic knowledge to an interpretation, and affords differing levels of understanding without distorting the extended metaphor of \\u2018weather is Waits\\u2019 emotions\\u2019. This article explores the advantages of a relevance theoretic approach to the stylistic analysis of lyrics. We discuss how the figurative language in Waits\\u2019 lyrics is foregrounded by the listener\\u2019s schematic/encyclopaedic knowledge of Waits\\u2019 history as a performer, of meteorological phenomena and of American culture. We argue that a comprehensive stylistic analysis of a song necessitates a consideration of numerous factors in addition to linguistic choice, including the presentation of the performer, the genre of music and the performer\\u2019s history. Such a consideration is paramount to (a) successful metaphorical mapping for the listener, (b) a full analysis of the text as a cultural artefact for the critic, and (c) the achievement of a cohesive and distinct style for the performer. \\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.\",\n          \"Background and objectives: Visual Schema Displacement Therapy (VSDT) is a novel therapy which has been described as a treatment for stress and dysfunction caused by a traumatic event. Although its developers claim this therapy is quicker and more beneficial than other forms of trauma therapy, its effectiveness has not been tested. Methods: We compared the efficacy of VSDT to an abbreviated EMDR protocol and a non-active control condition (CC) in two studies. In Study 1 participants (N = 30) were asked to recall three negative emotional memories under three conditions: VSDT, EMDR, and a CC, each lasting 8 min. Emotional disturbance and vividness of the memories were rated before and after the (within group) conditions. The experiment was replicated using a between group study. In Study 2 participants (N = 75) were assigned to one of the three conditions, and a follow-up after 6\\u20138 days was added. Results: In both studies VSDT and EMDR were superior to the CC in reducing emotional disturbance, and VSDT was superior to EMDR. VSDT and EMDR outperformed the CC in terms of reducing vividness. Limitation: Results need to be replicated in clinical samples. Conclusions: It is unclear how VSDT yields positive effects, but irrespective of its causal mechanisms, VSDT warrants clinical exploration. \\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd\",\n          \"Even though the rise of the neural machine translation (NMT) paradigm has brought a great deal of improvement to the field of machine translation (MT), the current translation results are still not perfect. One of the main reasons for this imperfection is the decoding task complexity. Indeed, the problem of finding the one best translation from the space of all possible translations was and still is a challenging problem. One of the most successful ways to address it is via n-best list re-ranking which attempts to reorder the n-best decoder translations according to some defined features. In this paper, we propose a set of new re-ranking features that can be extracted directly from the parallel corpus without needing any external tools. The feature set that we propose takes into account lexical, syntactic, and even semantic aspects of the n-best list translations. We also present a method for feature weights optimization that uses a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm. Our system has been evaluated on multiple English-to-Arabic and Arabic-to-English MT test sets, and the obtained re-ranking results yield noticeable improvements over the baseline NMT systems. \\u00a9 2019, Springer Nature B.V.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Arts and Humanity\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

No recent study has reported on Uganda\\u2019s state of public sector prosthetics services. This study aimed to document the landscape of major limb loss, and the structure of available prosthetics services in Uganda. Methods: This study involved a retrospective review of medical records at Mulago National Referral Hospital, Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital, and Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, and a cross-sectional survey of personnel involved in the fabrication and fitting of prosthetic devices across orthopaedic workshops in the country. Results: Upper limb amputations accounted for 14.2%, and lower limb accounted for 81.2%. Gangrene (30.3%) was the leading cause of amputation, followed by road traffic accidents and diabetes mellitus. Orthopaedic workshops offered decentralised services, and most materials used were imported. Essential equipment was largely lacking. Orthopaedic technologists had diverse experience and skill sets, but many other factors limited their service provision. Conclusion: The Ugandan public healthcare system lacks adequate prosthetic services both in terms of personnel and supporting resources, including equipment, materials, and components. The provision of prosthetics rehabilitation services is limited, especially in rural regions. Decentralising services could improve patients\\u2019 access to prosthetic services.Implications for Rehabilitation Availability and accessibility of prosthetic services are essential to the rehabilitation and reintegration of amputees into communities in Low-and-Middle-Income countries (LMICs). For stakeholders to formulate effective plans to address issues within prosthetics service provision, quality data on the current state of services is necessary. Service providers should prioritise the decentralisation of prosthetic rehabilitation services, especially for patients in rural areas, to improve access and reach of these services. To achieve optimal limb functionality after amputation for both lower and upper limb amputees, rehabilitation professionals working in LMICs should focus on delivering comprehensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation services. Orthopaedic personnel should ensure complete and accurate documentation of patient information following amputation to enable effective tracking and monitoring of patient care to improve outcomes of rehabilitation. \\u00a9 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\",\n          \"Background: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients have been shown to not achieve normal sagittal plane hip kinematics. However, previous studies have only conducted group level analysis and as such lack the sensitivity to highlight whether individual patients do achieve normal hip kinematics. As such this study looked to determine whether some patients with well-functioning THA achieve typical sagittal plane hip kinematics. Methods: Sagittal plane hip kinematics were collected on 11 well-functioning THA patients (Oxford Hip Score = 46 \\u00b1 3) and 10 asymptomatic controls using a 3-dimensional motion analysis system during self-paced walking. High-functioning THA patients were identified as those who displayed sagittal plane hip kinematics that were within the variance of the control group on average, and low-functioning patients as those who did not. Results: 5 THA patients were identified as high-functioning, displaying hip kinematics within the variance of the control group. High-functioning THA patients displayed peak hip flexion and extension values more closely aligned to asymptomatic control group than low-functioning patients. However, hip range of motion was comparable between high- and low-functioning total hip arthroplasty patients and reduced compared to controls. Conclusion: The presence of high-functioning THA patients who display comparable sagittal plane hip kinematics to controls suggests these patients do achieve normative function and challenges the conclusions of previous group level analysis. Understanding why some patients achieve better function post-operatively will aid pre- and post-operative practices to maximise functional recovery. \\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.\",\n          \"Background: Terrorist incidents lead to a range of mental health outcomes for people affected, sometimes extending years after the event. Secondary stressors can exacerbate them, and social support can provide mitigation and aid recovery. There is a need to better understand distress and mitigating factors among survivors of the Manchester Arena attack in 2017. Aims: We explored three questions. First, what experiences of distress did participants report? Second, how might secondary stressors have influenced participants' psychosocial recoveries? Third, what part has social support played in the relationships between distress and participants' recovery trajectories? Method We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of a convenience sample of survivors of the Manchester Arena bombing (N = 84) in January 2021 (3 years 8 months post-incident), and a longitudinal study of the same participants' scores on mental health measures over 3 years from September 2017. Results: Survivors' mental well-being scores in early 2021 were significantly lower than general population norms. Longitudinal follow-up provided evidence of enduring distress. Secondary stressors, specifically disruptions to close relationships, were associated with greater post-event distress and slower recovery. We found an indirect relationship between identifying with, and receiving support from, others present at the event and mental well-being >3 years later.
